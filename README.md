#  Listener

This is a new desk accessory for the Apple IIgs that allows an iOS device to connect to the GS over a network and stream text to it from voice dicatation.  It must be paired with the [ListenerApp](https://github.com/jeremysrand/ListenerApp) running on your iOS device.  See that project for details about obtaining the app.

This code was written during KansasFest 2021 as part of the HackFest project.  For information about how to use the application and do voice dictation to your Apple IIgs, read the [distribution Readme file](/Listener/Readme.md).
